# Object Tracking (Python)
I'm attempting to use features and centroids to track objects in an image

## Structure
main.py    : driver
Rect.py    : rect struct in python
Tracker.py : Tracker object

## Main
Handles the running of the program and passing of variables. Pulls frames from the video.

## Rect
Acts as the gate to be used on the frames

## Tracker
Serves to process frames and maintain features of the image and tracking
